            <h2>The Intersection of Sport and Science</h2>
            <p>This project began at the intersection of my life as an ultimate frisbee player and my academic path as an aspiring data scientist at <strong>UCLA</strong>. I’ve always been fascinated by the nuances of the game—the spatial dynamics of disc flight and the tactical decisions that increase the likelihood of winning. As an Applied Mathematics student, I realized that the eye test often doesn’t relay everything the data does. This project was born from a desire to bridge that gap, taking the untapped potential of professional <strong>Ultimate Frisbee Association (UFA)</strong> statistics and applying the same analytical standards and methods seen in sports like basketball or baseball.</p>

            <h2>The Technical Core</h2>
            <p>The technical core of this project involved building a robust data pipeline capable of handling the UFA’s API data across the 2022–2025 seasons. The way the UFA API provides its data is directly from both teams in a single game. This causes a need for extra care, as each side records the stats more useful for itself, and not for the other team.</p>
            <p>For example, while on defense, that team's stat taker will not record the passes made by the other team. In order to bring the data together into a functional game state dataframe for each game analyzed, I had to construct a pipeline that merged the away and home dataframes, eliminating duplicate events accurately in order to preserve data integrity.</p>
            <blockquote>Additionally, by augmenting the provided stats, I engineered specific spatial and temporal features to capture the "flow" of a game, including vertical and horizontal yardage for every throw.</blockquote>
            <p>This pipeline transformed thousands of individual events into a clean, game-flow-centric dataset, providing a granular look at how discs move across the field.</p>

            <h2>From Raw Data to Visual Insights</h2>
            <p>Once the data was refined, I transitioned the "Master Stats" output into <strong>Tableau</strong> to bring these metrics to life. The goal was to create a dashboard that wasn't just a collection of charts, but a tool to provide tactical insights for coaches and fans alike. Key visualizations include:</p>
            <ul class="insight-list">
                <li><strong>Spatial Heatmaps:</strong> Mapping completion percentages across different zones of the field to identify high-risk areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Game Pace Plots:</strong> Plotting offensive efficiency vs pass per point to see the correlation between pace and scoring.</li>
                <li><strong>Dimensional Risk Analysis:</strong> Charting scoring percentage and completion percentage versus field location to further understand risk areas.</li>

            <h2>Actionable Insights & Tactical Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Analyzing the aggregated 2022–2025 game states revealed several core inefficiencies and strategic imperatives for UFA teams. The dashboard highlights three primary tactical takeaways:</p>

            <div class="takeaway-card">
                <h3>1. The Sweet Spot of Offensive Pace</h3>
                <p>Data indicates that peak offensive efficiency occurs between <strong>5 and 10 passes per possession</strong>. This exposes the statistical inefficiency of both extremes: an over-reliance on immediate deep shots and prolonged "small ball" possessions. The numbers dictate that a well-rounded offense—capable of executing high-value, effective throws without allowing the possession to stagnate—is vital for consistent scoring.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="takeaway-card">
                <h3>2. Spatial Risk and the Sideline Penalty</h3>
                <p>Spatial analysis reveals a sharp decline in completion percentage when throws originate from the sidelines. The completion map and field-width plots strongly support a tactical shift: when the disc is trapped on the boundary, teams should prioritize immediate centering passes rather than forcing vertical progression down the line. Interestingly, a marginal uptick in completion rates at the absolute boundary suggests players intuitively adopt a highly risk-averse, possession-preservation mindset when they recognize this spatial trap.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="takeaway-card">
                <h3>3. Redzone Volatility and Break Conversions</h3>
                <p>Execution within both the offensive and defensive redzones disproportionately impacts game outcomes. The huck completion map demonstrates a significant drop in deep-shot success when originating near either endzone. Furthermore, the break conversion data shows that turnovers deep in either territory yield the highest probability of breaks. Consequently, a defining separator for elite teams is their statistical dominance and discipline in these high-pressure, high-leverage field positions.</p>
